-> requirements.txt
Text file that specifies the python packages and modules required to run the project.
Ensure all the necessary dependencies with required version and latest version of Python3 are available with the following command.
    >>> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

-> optdigits.tra
Contains the preprocessed data used for TRAINING using Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier. 
Taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits

-> optdigits.tes
Contains the preprocessed data used for TESTING using Multi Layer Perceptron Classifier. 
Taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits

-> GRP23_A03_IMPLEMENTATION.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook written in Python programming language. All the code relevant to the assignment is written in this notebook.
Make sure before running the notebook that, the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits database (Training and Testing) are present by the 
name of "optdigits.tra" and "optdigits.tes" respectively in the same directory as "GRP23_A03_IMPLEMENTATION.ipynb".

-> GRP23_A03_IMPLEMENTATION.pdf
The same code written in the jupyter notebook is also provided as a pdf document so that the evaluator does not have to start the Jupyter 
kernel every time they have to read the code. It also has all the readings and results obtained by running the code. It has the detailed
"model analysis reports" for each and every model that was trained as a part of this project.

-> GRP23_A03_REPORT.pdf
A brief report that discusses preprocessing of dataset, states the results, procedures, inferences and relevant theoretical backgrounds for 
all the parts (part 1 to 6) in the assignment.
