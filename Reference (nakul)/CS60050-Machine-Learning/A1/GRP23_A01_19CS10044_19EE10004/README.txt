-> requirements.txt
   Text file that specifies the python packages and modules required to run the project.
   Ensure all the necessary dependencies of required versions and latest version of Python3 are available with the following command
    	>>> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

-> ILPD.csv
   Contains the data used for training and testing of decision trees. Taken from https://www.kaggle.com/jeevannagaraj/indian-liver-patient-dataset

-> GRP23_A01_IMPLEMENTATION.ipynb
   Jupyter Notebook written in Python programming language. All the code relevant to the assignment is written in this notebook.

   - Launch jupyter notebook through terminal using the following command
      >>> jupyter notebook
   - Then open this notebook to view the code written and run to see the output results.

   Note: Please make sure before running the notebook, the Indian Liver Patients Dataset is present by the name of ILPD.csv and GRP23_A01_IMPLEMENTATION.ipynb are in the same directory.

-> GRP23_A01_IMPLEMENTATION.pdf
   The same code written in the jupyter notebook is also provided as a pdf document so that the evaluator does not have to start the Jupyter kernel every time they have to read the code.

-> GRP23_A01_REPORT.pdf
   A brief report that visualizes the dataset and states the results, procedures,inferences and relevant theoretical backgrounds for all the parts in the assignment.

-> GRP23_A01_DECISION_TREES
    ->  GRP23_A01_DT_PART02.pdf
    ->  GRP23_A01_DT_PART03.pdf
    ->  GRP23_A01_DT_PART04.pdf
   "GRP23_A01_DECISION_TREES" folder contains pdf files displaying the hierarchical representation of decision trees obtained in 2nd, 3rd and 4th parts of the assignment respectively. 
   The same decision trees are also attached in the "GRP23_A01_REPORT.pdf" file.
